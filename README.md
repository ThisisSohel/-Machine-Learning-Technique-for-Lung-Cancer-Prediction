##Project Title: Machine Learning Technique for 
Lung Cancer Prediction.

Project Overview：In this research project, we 
tried to introduce a framework where a dataset 
comprising of symptoms and other habitual 
characteristics of people are fed to train ML models 
after several steps of pre-processing to early 
diagnose the deadly disease named lung cancer.
Where we used different models like Naïve Bayes, 
SVM, Decision Tree-CART, Decision Tree-C4.5, 
ANN, KNN, MLP, Logistic Regression and Random 
Forest algorithms.

##Technology Used-
Python, Machine Learning.

My Role：Data Preprocessing, Model implementation and documentation.
Name of Part：RF, MLP, KNN, ANN, LR.
