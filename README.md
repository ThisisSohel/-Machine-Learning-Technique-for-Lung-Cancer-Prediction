# -Machine-Learning-Technique-for-Lung-Cancer-Prediction
To accomplish this task, in this project we implement several machine learning  classifiers, i.e., Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree-CART, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,  Decision Tree-C4.5, KNN, MLP, and ANN that are trained using pre-processed data. The dataset  is fed into the classification model by data preprocessing.
